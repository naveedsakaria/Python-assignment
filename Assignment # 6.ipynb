    "# Q # 1. Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer : Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another. For example, objects can inherit characteristics from other objects.\n",

    "# Q#2. List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "## It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objects can also be reused within an across applications. The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development. More effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and design, which lowers the overall cost of development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## It makes software easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reuse also enables faster development. Object-oriented programming languages come with rich libraries of objects, and code developed during projects is also reusable in future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## It provides a good framework for code libraries where the supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer. This is particularly useful for developing graphical user interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Better Productivity as OOP techniques enforce rules on a programmer that, in the long run, help her get more work done; finished programs work better, have more features and are easier to read and maintain. OOP programmers take new and existing software objects and \"stitch\" them together to make new programs. Because object libraries contain many useful functions, software developers don't have to reinvent the wheel as often; more of their time goes into making the new program."
